Notes and Comments :-

Something I wanna add is while I worked under two hours of this assignment, i am a bit if not completely happy with how it turned out. While the application is prone to some errors like github somehow refusing to accept the existence of my demo.js, I still feel it's decent. What I'm not happy with is the fact that I was unable to make it into a single frame application in the alloted time. 

For the first hour, I worked on brushing up the css and the index and coming to a complete page that I could work around. As of now, the calendar page complete with the css was done in the hour. The dashboard and its theme took more time. 


API and Data:-

Since the theme of the entire dashboard is automating a therapist's job, I would have no worried using IBM's Watson services and Sentiment analysis with an app that records and returns speech to text and runs sentiment analysis api on it, so as to discover what and how a person is feeling. That data and information would then be relayed to the therapist. 


UI/UX changes :-
- I believe if given more time, I could have made it more responsive and manageable. 
- The color scheme is slightly upheavel
- Properly grouping the sidebar and the navbar, as well as the charts would have made more sense.
